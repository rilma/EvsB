# E vs B fields

This respository contains the Python code developed to study the correlation between electric and magneic fields from the ground to the interplanetry medium. The results are published [here] (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijge/2012/648402/).

This [program] (corrMain.py) generates the plots presented below.

This plot shows the y-component of the interplanetry electric field measured by ACE satellite (red) and the zonal component of the zonal electric field in the equatorial ionosphere.

The evidence of the 90 degrees out of phase between the ionospheric electric field and the geomagnetic field at the magnetic equator.

Here is the parallel component of the magnetic field versus universal time (UT) and GSE coordinates measured by GOES-12 (Long. W 75) satellite.
